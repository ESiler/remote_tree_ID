title: "In Which I Attempt To Train a Computer Vision Model to Find and Characterize Trees Using Michigan State University's Campus Tree Data"

description: |
  Welcome to my remote tree ID repo!

installation:
  steps:
    - Clone this repo (note: this code was designed using Python 3.9 and Linux Mint):
      - `git clone https://github.com/ESiler/remote_tree_ID`
      - `cd remote_tree_ID`
    - Create and activate a virtual environment, e.g.:
      - `python -m venv ../tree_env`
      - `source ../tree_env/bin/activate`
    - Load dependencies:
      - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - You can run the scripts in order or jump to the one you're interested in. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!

repository_contents:
  - "00_get_campus_tree_gis_data.ipynb: Pulls detailed MSU campus tree data from ArcGIS."
  - "01_Train_Test_Split.ipynb: This script performs the train/test split and does lots of other data processing and formatting."
  - "02_shuffle_files_for_yolo.sh: Script for shuffling files for YOLO by making symlinks. This allows you to do multiple train/test splits without disturbing the actual files"
  - "03_train_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook script for training the model."
  - "04_get_single_tree_pix.ipynb: Downloads individual tree images from ESRI."
  - "05_process_tree_pix.ipynb: Processes the downloaded tree images."
  - "06_single_tree_models.ipynb: Runs single tree characterization models using the principle components formed in script 05."
  - "Y1_run_yolo.py": This script allows you to train yolo models from the command line, which is useful for running them on Great Lakes or other compute clusters.
  - "misc: Supplementary scripts such as exporatory data analysis that are informationally useful but not critical to the pipeline."
