# In Which I Attempt To Train a Computer Vision Model to Find and Characterize Trees Using Michigan State University's Campus Tree Data

## Description/Intro
Welcome to my remote tree ID repo! Thanks for checking it out!

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
 -- Note: this code was designed using python 3.9 and Linux Mint. 
> git clone https://github.com/ESiler/remote_tree_ID
> cd remote_tree_ID
2. Create and an appropriate virtual environment, e.g.:
> python -m venv ../tree_env

3. Activate virtual environment, e.g.:
> source ../tree_env/bin/activate

4. Load dependencies, e.g.:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

5. You can run the scripts in order, or go to the one you're interested in Please feel free to reach out with any questions!

## Repository Table of Contents:
00_get_campus_tree_gis_data.ipynb | A script that pulls detailed MSU campus tree data from arcgis
01_Train_Test_Split.ipynb | This script does a whole bunch of crap, idk.
02_shuffle_files_for_yolo.sh |
03_train_model.ipynb |   
04_get_single_tree_pix.ipynb | Downloads all individual tree images from ESRI.
05_process_tree_pix.ipynb | 
06_single_tree_models.ipynb | Runs single tree charaterization models using the principle components formed in script 05. 
misc | These are supplementary scripts I used for informational purposes but that are not important parts of the pipeline.
